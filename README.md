# AC-to-variable-DC-power-supply


	Objectives:
The main objective of this project is to create an AC to DC converter which takes 220V AC as input and outputs a regulated DC voltage between the range of +3V to +15V.

	Introduction:
The project consists of three main comparisons which are between theoretical values, simulated values and practical values.
